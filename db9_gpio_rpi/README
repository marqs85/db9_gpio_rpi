    ---  Db9 joystick driver for Raspberry Pi's GPIO ---

1. Overview

The driver is designed to be used with db9 joysticks connected to Raspberry
Pi's GPIO. Up to 2 joysticks of following types can be used with the driver:

    -Atari, Commodore, Amiga and other db9 multisystem joysticks (1-3 buttons)
    -Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) gamepads
    -Sega Saturn controllers (Note: custom connector instead of db9)
    -Amiga CD32 gamepads
    -PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 gamepads (2+2 buttons, turbo fire optional)*

The driver is based on db9 kernel module for parport (see
linux/Documentation/input/joystick-parport.txt), but uses different pinout and
parameters. No warranty - use at your own risk.

* Having support for PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 controllers in this driver is not as
  out of place is it first may seem. Despite using a DIN-8 connector instead 
  of the titular DB9, the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 controller is internally very
  similar to the Mega Drive/Genesis controllers.


2. Required hardware

-Raspberry Pi and supported joysticks
-One DB9* connector (male) per joystick, and wires (e.g. a ribbon cable)

* PC Engine: Mini DIN-8 (female), TurboGrafx-16: DIN-8 (female)


3. Connecting the joysticks

RPi GPIO pinout: http://elinux.org/Rpi_Low-level_peripherals
NOTE: the driver does not use pins which are assigned different GPIO IDs on
different revision boards, so checking of board revision is not required.

The available GPIOs are divided into 2 ports, PORT1 and PORT2. Both use 7 data
pins, which are listed below:

Button/Function     PORT1 GPIO ID        PORT2 GPIO ID
UP                  4                    15
DOWN                7                    17
LEFT                8                    18
RIGHT               9                    22
FIRE1               10                   23
FIRE2 / SELECT1     11                   24
FIRE3 / SELECT0     14                   25

Pins P1-01 (3.3V) and P1-06 (GND) are used as common power and ground for
all joysticks. These supplies are also available on a few other pins (see
the pinout), which can be helpful when multiple joysticks are used. Note
that 3.3V is used instead of 5V, although all supported joysticks requiring
power are designed for 5V. This is done to avoid addition of level shifters,
since the GPIO pins on RPi use 3.3V logic levels and are not 5V tolerant.

Controllers using CMOS chips should function without an issue with 3.3V
supply, but functionality of TTL-based joysticks cannot be guaranteed,
although several controllers (e.g. Genesis) have been successfully tested
with 3.3V supply. In case your controller does not work properly with 3.3V
supply, you can switch to 5V supply if appropiate level shifters are added
between output pins of joystick and GPIO input pins (see signal directions
in the sections below). For example, 74LVC245 is an IC which can be used for
this downconversion.

The connection diagram for GPIO is also illustrated on the driver wikipage:

4. Configuring the driver

The driver is loaded and unloaded with command "modprobe" (as root or with
sudo). It is recommended to use "--first-time" -option with modprobe since the
default output is not very verbose (see "man modprobe").


4.1 Configuring the joysticks

The driver is loaded in the following way:

# modprobe --first-time db9_gpio_rpi map=<PORT1>,<PORT2>

, where <PORT1> and <PORT2> describe the joystick type connected to the
corresponding port, which may be one of the following:

    0 = no connection
    1 = Multisystem 1-button joystick
    2 = Multisystem 2-button joystick
    3 = Multisystem 3-button joystick
    4 = Mega Drive (Genesis) standard pad (3+1 buttons)
    5 = Mega Drive (Genesis) 3rd-party pad (5+1 buttons)
    6 = Mega Dribe (Genesis) 6-button pad (6+2 buttons)
    7 = Sega Saturn controller (any type)
    8 = Amiga CD32 gamepad
    9 = PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 gamepad (2+2 buttons)

For example, if a standard Mega Drive pad is connected to PORT1 and a Saturn
controller to PORT2, the command would be
"modprobe --first-time db9_gpio_rpi map=4,7".

The following command can be used to verify if the correct controller was
inserted to the intended port:
# tail /var/log/kern.log

If the joystick is swapped to another type while RPi is powered, it is
recommended to unload the driver before (not after) swapping the controllers:
# modprobe --first-time -r db9_gpio_rpi
This sets GPIO pins configured to outputs (in previous setup) back to inputs.

When using modprobe, the configuration does not persist over reboots. To
configure the driver to be loaded on startup, add the driver name and joystick
map to /etc/modules (e.g. "db9_gpio_rpi map=4,7")


4.2 Testing the joysticks
# apt-get install joystick
# jstest /dev/input/jsX
    where X corresponds to the pad index (0-1)
